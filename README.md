This is just a working demo, feel free to reach out and give support on this project, currently the project is almost out of the alpha stage and is launchable, however the saturation changing aspect in xrandr is quite broken and buggy, im working on it.
This is still my 1st project to give support, under the Gnu 3.0 Feel free to use the code and make it better, with care --METADev.
